# Gym Membership App
This application is mirroring a cross-platform iOS app for a gym. The elements are being converted to native Swift UI in order to create a more responsive and better experience on iOS

# This is a bad Draft
Keep in mind that this repository is a draft, the Swift code might be a bit badly writen. I’m not going to refactor a project which virtually nobody will see, therefore some Views, Structures or other components might seem a bit tacky or badly made. This is a result of a "βλέποντας και κάνοντας" approach, which literally translates literaly to "seeing and doing" (but means "play it by ear")
